# Brief

This repository is **Brief** — a public, phone-first news deck. Hebrew is the default language (`dir=rtl`). English is an optional switcher on the **same URL**. It is **not** a 3D printer or filament tracker.

The site is a two-lane static briefing:

- **News / חדשות** (teal) — geopolitics overlay
- **Markets / שווקים** (amber) — tape, earnings, calendar, watch

Tape is data. There are no trade recommendations.

## Language

First visit is Hebrew. A switcher (`עברית | English`) sits above the News/Markets tabs (and on Archive/404 chrome). The choice is stored in `localStorage` (`brief-lang`) so refresh keeps it.

Optional `#he` / `#en` hashes set the language once without replacing the page. News/Markets still use `#news` / `#markets`. On `file://`, hash writes are skipped so `replaceState` cannot break local opens.

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8080/

`file://` also works: open `index.html` directly.

## GitHub Pages

Public URL: **https://jifa52.github.io/KNG.3D/**

The site files are already on `main` at the repo root (`index.html`, `assets/`, `archive/`, `briefings/`). GitHub’s API token in this project cannot create a Pages site, so enable it once in the UI:

1. **Settings → General → Change repository visibility → Public** (required for a public news deck)
2. **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from a branch**
3. Branch **`main`**, folder **`/` (root)** → **Save**

Optional: set source to **GitHub Actions**, then run **Actions → GitHub Pages → Run workflow**. Push to `main` only verifies the static files; it does not try to create Pages (this token cannot).

No Vercel.
